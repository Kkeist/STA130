    "Here's a summary of your chatbot sessions so far:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initial Markovian Chatbot Code**:\n",
    "   - You shared a basic Markov chain implementation that tracks word usage and which word follows another word in a sequence. The model creates a dictionary (`word_used`) to count occurrences of words and another dictionary (`next_word`) to track the next word that follows a given word. This forms the foundation for a Markov chain-based text generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Markovian Chatbot Code Explanation**:\n",
    "   - I explained how the code works by processing words sequentially, counting word occurrences, and storing relationships between words. Each word's occurrence and its subsequent word are recorded to form the predictive model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #1**:\n",
    "   - You provided an extension of the original code where the chatbot considers **bi-grams** (pairs of consecutive words) instead of single words. This improves the context of word prediction, making the generated text more coherent.\n",
    "   - I broke down the extension, explaining how word pairs are tracked and how the model can better predict the next word based on two preceding words instead of one.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Markovian Chatbot Extension #2**:\n",
    "   - In this session, you introduced a new extension where the chatbot tracks **character-specific speech patterns** using a dataset (`avatar`) of characters. Each character has its own Markov chain model, and the chatbot builds separate models for each character’s dialogue.\n",
    "   - I explained how the nested dictionaries are structured to store word usage and next-word probabilities per character, allowing for character-driven text generation with distinct speech patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each session builds upon the previous one, enhancing the chatbot's ability to predict text in more sophisticated ways. Let me know if you'd like any additional details on any of these sessions!"

    "- **Objective:** Implement a basic Markovian Chatbot.\n",
    "- **Code Details:**\n",
    "  - Used `defaultdict` to track word frequencies and transitions.\n",
    "  - Built two dictionaries:\n",
    "    - `word_used`: Tracks how often each word appears.\n",
    "    - `next_word`: Tracks how often each word follows another word.\n",
    "  - Iterated through a list of words to populate these dictionaries.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Objective:** Extend the Markovian Chatbot to incorporate character-specific contexts.\n",
    "- **Code Details:**\n",
    "  - Processed a dataset (`avatar`) to extract and count character strings.\n",
    "  - Used nested `defaultdict` structures to track:\n",
    "    - Frequencies of two-word phrases for each character (`word_used2C`).\n",
    "    - Frequencies of words following two-word phrases for each character (`next_word2C`).\n",

Just give the instructions that it should do, and it will do the tasks.\n",

    "For my experience of using chatbots, it is useful to teach concepts and give examples with the terms. However, sometimes the examples will be limited, as there is not a large variety of examples for the terms. It will explain the work in each step, and the layout of ChatGPT's answer with the variables in different fonts from the explanation words is clear. It is a good learning tool to understand code. However, it is a language model instead of a human being; it needs to follow a prompt to work properly. Sometimes the memory is annoying. It will always conbine the things together or forget the right information."

    "With the use of chatbots in this class, actually it gives me a new sight of using chatbots to learn things. I used to only consider chatbots a tool for companionship or ask some daily questions. I learn about the function that it can teach me with the terms I don't know (I ask it about equivalence class for my math class too). It can also help figure out the mistake in the code, understand other people's code, and generate code for the user. So as an assistance tool, it will be useful for learning coding, statistics, and data science, as we can learn about the code without actually going into CS, so it can save our time and make us focus on the statistic contents. It can also help statisticians learn the code well, so it is easier for them to cooperate with CS people. However, I don't really agree with the use of AI in art areas; it is suitable for statistics. "

ChatGPT still suggests I learn the coding skills. It is useful for the data-analyzing work. The skills that the chatbot provides are okay. It gives me a view of which aspects I may be planning on working on. However, it is only a brief review. If I want to know detail things about it, I need to ask deeper questions, like what specifically I need to learn. It is just like throwing names of tools at me. It will be hard if I know nothing about this area. \n",
    "For the same reason, it is like we need some basic knowledge to be able to ask questions to chatbots. For example, I can ask the chatbot to give me the value in variables when it is iterating. But for someone who has never learned Python before, they will never be able to ask this because they have never run their code and tested the code. When I was in my grade 12 English class, we tried to let ChatGPT write essays for us. ChatGPT is only able to give descriptions and some general ideas. It cannot give deeper thoughts depending on the articles. Like it is using fancy words and the essay looks great, it is only simulating what human beings do. It will be a good choice to get some general ideas or find some options from a huge amount of information on the internet. For the deeper studies, we still need real human beings to teach us."
